# Housing-Price-Prediction
Real Estate Price Prediction Project üè°üìà
This repository presents an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting house sale prices. The project utilizes various data science techniques, from extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and rigorous Feature Engineering to advanced Regression modeling, providing a reliable tool for real estate valuation.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary objective is to develop a highly accurate regression model that can estimate the final sale price of a residential property. This model can be used by buyers, sellers, or real estate investors to gain a more objective, data-driven valuation of a property based on its characteristics.

üìä Dataset
This project is typically built using rich, multi-featured datasets such as the Ames Housing Dataset (from the Kaggle competition) or the California Housing Dataset.

Target Variable: SalePrice (or equivalent continuous value).

Features: The model considers a wide range of factors, including both numerical and categorical data:

Property Size: (e.g., GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, LotArea in square feet)

Location/Neighborhood: (e.g., Neighborhood, ZipCode)

Quality/Condition: (e.g., OverallQual, OverallCond)

Structure: (e.g., BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, YearBuilt, GarageCars)

üß† Methodology and Key Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of the target variable (SalePrice) to check for skewness.

Identify correlations between features (using heatmaps) and the target variable to select the most influential features.

Analyze the relationship between categorical features (like Neighborhood) and the price (using box plots).

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Handling Missing Values: Employ strategies like imputation (mean/median) or advanced modeling to deal with missing data.

Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in key features that could negatively impact model training.

Feature Transformation: Apply log transformations (e.g., to SalePrice) to normalize skewed data distributions.

Categorical Encoding: Convert text-based categorical features into numerical format (e.g., using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).

Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure no single feature dominates the model.
